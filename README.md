# IEEE Firefighter

Project was developed by the IEEE RAS Student Chapter from ISCTE-IUL, for the participation in the 2003 edition 
of [Robô Bombeiro competition](http://ubik2.ipg.pt/robobombeiro/) held in Guarda, on Instituto Politécnico da Guarda.

This java project (developed using Eclipse IDE) consists on the code used to program a NXT Lego Mindstorms brick 
flashed with LeJos firmware, in order to acquire information from lego sensors and from an arduino (via bluetooth).
On the test area you can find some scripts used mainly to test sensors.

The films of three rounds were the code was used can be seen here:
